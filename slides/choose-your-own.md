### How was your PhD experience?
<!-- .element: id="my-phd" -->

- My PhD position was somewhere between theory and data analysis. This means that my training and work is mostly behind a computer screen at a desk. 

- I made a shift in the middle going from one topic to another.
This was the choice of my supervisor, who decided that this new route was a more strategic way for the group to take and that it would secure him better odds at landing a big ERC grant.

- It was in a small research group at the institute with three/four other PhD students in the group. 

- I had my stay abroad in Heidelberg at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, but my stay got interrupted by the pandemic.

- Pandemic sucked, covid 3 days before defence
