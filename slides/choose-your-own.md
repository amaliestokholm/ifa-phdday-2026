<!-- .element: id="academic-ladder" -->
<!-- .slide: class="small-text"-->

The academic ladder in Denmark:

- <b>Postdoc</b>: Fixed-term (~6 months-3 years, typically). Common to take several temporary positions to build up your academic profile and experience before applying for a more senior role.
- <b>Assistant professor</b>: Fixed-term, but of higher seniority and salary than postdoc.
    - <b>Tenure-track</b>: After maximum six years, the employee is assessed and if they pass, they will be associate professor.
- <b>Associate</b>: Permanent position*
- <b>Professor</b>: Permanent position; a promotion for perticularly talented senior researchers.
- <b>Head of Department/Dean/Rector</b>: A posible adminstrative/political route for senior researchers.

Note:
Re-employment of an employee in several consecutive fixed-term positions is possible; however, such employment may not exceed eight years.

### How to get a job in academia?
<!-- .element: id="job" -->

Well apply :)

Fresh out of a PhD you typically have two kinds of options for postdoctoral positions:

- Hired on a project lead by another PI: Someone has funding to hire you on a specific project with a goal in mind.
    - Most common
    - Conditions depend on your line manager, research location, research group, etc.
- Fellowship funding: You get your own funding and choose your host institution.
    - This is very competitive and requires a strong publication records and a clear research vision.
    - High prestige, very competitive.
    - Examples: Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships (EU), Harvard Society of Fellows (US), Carnegie Fellowships (US),  DFF International postdoctoral grants (DK), Carlsberg Internationaliserings stipends (DK), Carlsberg Reintegration stipends (DK), etc
- Industry/impact funding: Funding for research carried out in collaboration with a private company.
    - Examples: Innavation Fund Denmark (DK), some bigger private sector companies**.

Note:
- Your work situation depends a lot on your line manager, the research group/environment/institute, team members, etc

[But how to get a job?](#job)

Note:
You can win the Nobel prize, then I think I can pick and choose your host institute.
I jest, but there is no recipe for how to get a permanent position.
It depends on the funding landscape, whether you fit into the strategy of the host institute,

### How was your PhD experience?
<!-- .element: id="my-phd" -->

- During my PhD, my work was somewhere between theory and data analysis. This means that my training and work were mostly behind a computer screen at a desk. 
- I was part of a small research group at the institute with three/four other PhD students in my group. 
- Halfway through, I changed topic. This was stressfull and not handle as well as it could have, but ultimately I do not regret it.
- The pandemic hit and that changed the nature of the last part of my PhD.
- Overall, I enjoyed being a PhD student.
- In hindsight (and IMO), we are teaching too much at IFA.

Note:
- Halfway-through, I changed subfield and goals. This was the choice of my supervisor, who decided that this new route was a more strategic way for the group to take and that it would secure him better odds at landing a big ERC grant.

### Work-life balance
<!-- .element: id="work-life" -->

<q>A healthy work-life balance allows everyone to excel at work and take care of their personal wellbeing outside of the office.</q>

- I have fun <b>now</b>

- I stopped taking every advice

- I try to be the best <b> whole </b> person I can

- I surround myself with real and honest friends

More great advice by Prof. Radhika Nagpal <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/guest-blog/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/" target="_blank">in her blog post</a>

Note:
I remember to have fun now. I do fun science work stuff, I take time to learn new fun things even when I also have other priorities.

I stopped taking every advice. People, even with the best intentions, lie.
If you ask them what is important to succeed, people will tell you everything they did that they think helped them. Plus everything they wish they had done. Plus all the things their friend did. This list will be given without annotation and it is a list that no single person can ever accomlish. And you will receive that list, be in shock, then be depressed with a strong feeling of guilt and a desire to quit. 
And this person truely wanted you to success. So even with the best intentions, advice can be heartbreakingly dangerous.
So I have applied a heavy filter on how I take advice and I can only encourage you to give it some thought as well.

I try to be the best whole person I can. I am a scientist, but I am also a friend, a daughter, a partner, a nerd, a person with multitudes. So it is okay for me to not do work in the evening or weekends and to have holidays doing something else. When energy is replenished, it also makes me better at my work.

I build an environment of collegues and friends that value fun, whimsy, trust and honesty. People that I care about and that care about me and that makes every loss easier to handle and every win better.
